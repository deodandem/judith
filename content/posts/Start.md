A little before the middle of July. Apartment semi-vacated, and all objects removed from the kitchen counter in preparation for counter work. Later to find a mild gray shade of paint used for the cosmetic renovation. She went to visit two apartments in NYC, where she planned to move within a month, and stayed with a long-time friend, L, who had once been her lover. L was now with a new girlfriend, which made her cheerful and distant. The year before they had had sex under similar circumstances: a recreational visit with some shopping destinations, and with the desire to see her psychoanalyst, but without plans to move. D had bought a ramen bowl and two dishes; it had been, in essence, a shopping and gathering expedition.

It had been four years since she had last moved. The last move had been bicoastal: from Stanford, CA to Ithaca, NY. It had been happy and respectable to move between the two places, from one academic institution to another, from one degree program to another. The impending move, the present move, was instead suffused with an air of debauchery, of mistakenness. It took her away from the calm of the university town to the numerosity of the bodies of men in the city. This caused some, like her mother, to believe that she would fester there, or that she would not finish her dissertation. D thought this was a reasonable concern. Before the visit, D had interacted with three of her men; one via letter, one at his house, and one on break where he worked. She did not maintain an exclusive, God's-eye-view of her relations with them, but rather chose to speak or write to each about the others, such that each had a kind of God's-eye-view of where they stood in relation to her and her Others. She also had a fourth man, her analyst, who knew a little more about them than the rest, though it was hard to say if he knew that much more.

She texted her first and last female partner to ask if she could stay over, and texted her analyst that she would be coming to see him in person on Monday, but that she would have to cancel Friday's session, during which she'd be in transit. *I was worried that each of the men I knew had become "tricks"â€”tricks I turned, or tricks that turned me. I worried that the more consistent I became in being able to entertain them that something bad would happen. Bad for whom?*

She figured she was moving in order to enter a kind of religious order, the religious order of psychoanalysis. But there was also the precarity of trying to make creative work, in that place, in the non-religious ones who worked freelance *Set dresser,* the profession of a potential roommate. *Pro-domme,* a word she learned from the mouth of a man who took her back to his place. After the visit she went straight to A's place and ate his food. A had seemed to miss her, while she had been away for the five nights. He solicited her, he made her sweetly marinated chicken with perilla leaves and purple rice, he made her ice cream, with grilled peaches. She spoke about her time with men and A seemed more possessive than usual. The power went out and she said she couldn't respond to messages from other men. After reading that she had returned to Ithaca the previous night, the other member of her hive, M, said the next morning: "i could have come to fuck you." Judith smiled at this text. "no you couldn't, my pussy was booked," is what she wanted to say, but she didn't, it was enough to imagine it.
