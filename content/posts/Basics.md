**Q:**

How do you think about the ethics of sex work, on the client side? In other words, does a good life, for your client, involve paying you for sexual services? What are the benefits and limitations of SW?

**A:**

As a client, you should feel the pressure of the expense as a boon for thinking about why this is important to you and what you hope to come away with after each encounter. If I determine that it's worth seeing you in private, I want to be a participant in your pursuit of your desires.

Pursuing your desires and having them satisfied but not permanently satisfied by a real person, I think, can free up a lot of energy, making you more engaged in other areas of your life that matter. I'd also like to help you think differently about your wants and needs, so that the stuckness associated with repetitive patterns (whether it be something that you feel is stuck or wrong with respect to your sexuality, and specifically with respect to the use of pornography or sexual services) can be modified.


I envision this as a thing with a beginning and an end. My supervisor, for psychoanalytic work, told me that he tells his patients that he'd much rather have them come in three times a week and finish their analysis in a couple of years than have them come in once a week and stick around for a decade. I feel this way about sex work too. Unlike a love relationship, we can and should expect that a transactional sexual relationship should have a kind of terminus, though when that is and how that terminus is to be determined is not so easy to tell in advance.

<b>Q:</b>

Would you go on an in-person date with me?

**A:**

It's not outside of the realm of possibility, but there are several logistical items that we'd have to be on the same page about, including price and the background check process: the industry standard for escorts is to ask for ID and proof of employment, whose purpose is to make sure that you're not a cop. I value discretion, for I'd lose business otherwise.

Outcall and incall are both possibilities, though I have a slight preference for an outcall experience in a hotel of your choosing. Or we could go on a first date that doesn't end in a private place, if you'd like.

**Q:** Do you have an Onlyfans or Fansly? Do you sell custom content?

**A:** Not at this time, because I value the synchronicity of my work. However, I do sometimes share photographs and tweets on **[X.](http://twitter.com/judith_chilo)**

**Q:**

What motivated you to start camming? Why do you do this? Is this a short-term or long-term thing? Do you have another profession?

**A:**

During the pandemic, when I was far more isolated, I would watch models on CB to decompress at the end of the day. Beyond the immediate horniness this triggered in me, I found myself admiring and interested in the work the women did and in how the crowd interacted with them. I also loved the token coin sound, and continue to love it.

I was a graduate student with a stipend, busy writing and teaching, and not yet detransitioned. About four years later I found myself in the position of taking on contract work as a college admissions essay tutor as I pursued post-graduate training to practice psychoanalysis in NYC. The contract work I took on was frustrating to me, and I have found that my interest in creative writing has overtaken any remaining desire I have to complete my dissertation and/or pursue an academic career.

The training I'm in will take three or four more years for me to complete. I'm planning to use this journey in sex work to both fund my life (on a meager and basic level, so I can afford rent, out-of-pocket health expenses, and educational expenses, and hopefully move into a studio or one-bedroom), and to explore a different form of social work.

<b>Q:</b>

Where are you from? Do you speak other languages?

<b>A:</b>

I am American. I grew up on both the West and East Coast and have lived in California, Washington, Virginia, and New York. I primarily speak English, though I spoke some Mandarin growing up with my Taiwanese grandmother. My father is Korean, I don't speak the language. I studied Spanish and Spanish-language literature in college. I also studied Portuguese, French, Japanese, and Ancient Greek (a little).

<b>Q:</b>

Can you say more about your detransition, and transition?

<b>A:</b>

Yeah, in most cursory terms, I was born female, and was fairly boyish as a child, perhaps in part due to my mother's influenceâ€”she wanted a boy, and would often speak poorly of girls and femininity. In middle and high school I felt upset with pubertal changes to my body and uncomfortable with my position as a girl, especially when I started dating boys in high school. I discovered the possibility of being trans, and began to identify as a boy when I was 16. At the age of 18, I got a prescription for testosterone, which I continued to take until the July of 2022.

Between 2019 and 2022 I slowly fell in love, hard, with a classmate from high school who had known me first as a girl, and who struck up a rather lovely email and letter-based correspondence with me years later. My desire for him led me to feel, on a raw and sexual and intuitive level, a new sense of self as female, and several months into my first analysis, I made the decision to detransition. I also detransitioned, in part, because I was curious to see what it would be like to date other men as a woman.

Taking testosterone made me fairly serious, studious, and isolated, as well as somewhat restless, and highly motivated to exercise, which involved lifting, running, and cycling. I was more motivated to masturbate and look at porn, but had less of a sense of self as sexual, and far less developed sexual fantasies. It also made me leaner, hairier, and enlarged my clitoris and deepened my voice. When I stopped taking testosterone, I felt a drop in energy and often felt quite sleepy. I did laser hair removal to get rid of the hair on my face and have since used an IPL machine to reduce hair growth on my legs. I get cold more easily.

Psychologically, I feel very happy and intellectually stimulated. My raw sex drive isn't as urgent or consistent as it was when I was male, but my sense of interest in pursuing sexual experiences is far higher. I feel less inhibited in a lot of ways. However I do still get sleepy more easily, and am less motivated to engage in intense physical exertion.

<b>Q:</b>

Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend? What's your type?

**A:**

I'm non-monogamous and am seeing a few people at any given time. I'm not interested in being in a committed, monogamous relationship at this time. My partners know that I do sex work and know about my attitudes towards relationships and monogamy. My "type" varies but I seem to be attracted to people with sharp, rough, or angular physical characteristics. It's also important to me that my partner isn't possessive, and that he (usually he) has a kind of "zen" or "realist" attitude towards the present and the future. That he doesn't try to mold me into something I'm not and that he doesn't try to mold himself into something he's not for the sake of attracting me. I also have trouble with men who behave like they really want to please me in bed. I prefer someone who isn't afraid to be selfish, who takes what they want first, and then perceives my reaction and adjusts to it or inquires into it.

I mostly look out for physical attraction when I'm dating. I have trouble dating people who are in creative fields or who put a lot into their creative pursuits, probably because most of the people I've met who fall into that category ended up being both insecure and possessive, and I would feel uncomfortable being fetishized for my "taste" or for being "intellectual." I really prefer being wanted on the basis of my physical features or the way I talk rather than on the basis of abstract virtues.

Lastly, I'm drawn to men who have a bit of a submissive streak. I don't have experience with dating any avowed masochists because I don't like the idea of gratifying a masochist for free. But I'm interested in being a domme to someone who would pay me for it and whom I like.
