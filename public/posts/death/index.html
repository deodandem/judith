    <content><div class="standard" style="margin-bottom:175px;">
<p>I am an American with this little domain; 23-46.com.</p>
<p>Once I started a blog that was out of public circulation.</p>
<p>It was a defense against the decorum required of public writing, which I believed would keep me from working to write what mattered most to me. I preferred to think of it as a space of formalistic, structural, and creative freedom, but it was in fact a site for the most basic form of inward research, self-oriented and self-absorbed diarism.</p>
<p>This is all to say that what I wrote was ugly to me, on some level. Even if there were moments that I found beautiful or worthy of wonder or marvel, they weren&rsquo;t in the right container. The mess of digging around would dilute the aesthetic effects of those better moments. When I began, I had been reading Montaigne and thinking about the humble but brilliant origins of the <em>essai,</em> and I had been familiar for several months with the speculative beauty of Sheila Heti&rsquo;s &ldquo;autofiction,&rdquo; which often read to me like Pascal&rsquo;s <em>Pensées</em>, and I knew Rachel Cusk&rsquo;s indirect discourse of the <em>Outline</em> novels, wherein the narrator fades into the wall of her own narration: she tells us what she hears, in the words of her interlocutors, and what she says in response to their words, but without betraying her inner thoughts. In this sense she becomes a narrator, an off-center, omniscient, immaterial, female God. These were the kinds of writings that I wanted to create.</p>
<p>God—it&rsquo;s not that I wanted to be God. I wanted to be done-for. I had to know when I would be finished, in order to continue with life and work. So I set an outer limit; I planned to die at the age of forty-six, or twice my age at the time. I had chosen the number on account of the fact that it was the age at which César Vallejo had died.</p>
<p>In recent weeks I&rsquo;ve considered what it would mean to make the private website public, but I find in it a mixture of two issues that keep me from doing so. The first lies in a sense of its incoherence, its meaninglessness under the gaze of an outsider. I&rsquo;ve gestured at this. But the first point is only significant because of the second, which is that the site is so full of reports on men. Men I&rsquo;ve known, men I&rsquo;ve desired, men who are all alive. The possibility of exposure matters less than the fact that this practice of writing about men strikes me as embarrassing and unscrupulous. It&rsquo;s embarrassing on account of its size and length—it looks like someone trying to be literary royalty, and instead falling flat on the sidewalk. It looks like I&rsquo;m wearing the wrong shoes or the wrong pants, or that my face doesn&rsquo;t fit well with the strange sunglasses I&rsquo;ve chosen for myself. I&rsquo;m sure most women talk about their dating lives with their confidants, and that some men do this too, but it seems less likely to me that there would be many women and men who write long emails about their dating lives to their friends. Talk about one&rsquo;s dates is meant to be inchoate, and embarrassing, and unrecorded save in contexts of fictive artifice. What I&rsquo;m doing is a perversion of the normal practices of confession, which should be oral and evanescent or highly wrought. I suppose the barest marker of this perversion lies in the fact that I am not asking for advice or affirmation from a listener when I write about the men. Neither am I looking to make detailed fictional worlds around these characters. What I&rsquo;m doing is neither sufficiently artistic nor sufficiently social to be swallowed as usual, and some of this lies in the lack of dialogue, the lack of a question. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; what my &ldquo;goals&rdquo; are.</p>
<p>But what if there&rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with the observations of men? What if it is all mostly flattering, and each man consented to having what I wrote about them read by anyone else? What if my real reasons for keeping the material private are of the purely selfish sort—the sense that what I&rsquo;ve written isn&rsquo;t good, or that it&rsquo;ll reveal more about myself, about how I am in fact mediocre, unskilled, evil, terrible, unlikable, or boring?</p>
<p>I hate how I think in these moments, inviting all these counterfactuals.</p>
<p>What matters, at the core of all this, is that there&rsquo;s a terrible, quasi-infanticidal streak in how I read what I write. This terror or terribleness of mine is a decadent affliction that results from having the time and the education and the ability to spend long stretches of time in study. Maybe I even have skill, or a specific point of view worth making coherent. But my issue, or the issue that leads me to write here, is self-referential—and I have a hard time talking about because it seems so unproblematic whenever I try to describe it. My issue is that I think of my writing as a terrible symptom, and intransitive symptom of nothing, and that I think this symptom plays with something that&rsquo;s less a symptom than its bedrock: my relationship with the category of femaleness, and with the cunt.</p>
<hr>
<p>I see various men over the course of seven months. There is a new man each month, or a new man or two. Each month, I meet with the &ldquo;new man or two&rdquo; and sometimes have sex with him. I&rsquo;m not particularly profligate, but I also refuse to settle into monogamy, so the series continues to elongate. Sometimes I see two men during the same period of time, choosing one of the days of the weekend for one, and another day of the weekend or week for the other. These numbers, and the attendant logistics of blocking out time, matter insofar as they mark the rhythm or temporal texture of this promiscuity. I see a psychoanalyst in New York City four times a week. It&rsquo;s important for me to use that term—&ldquo;promiscuity&rdquo;—in the sessions, again to mark the rhythm of my obsession with the concept, or the way of life it represents for me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m promiscuous,&rdquo; I say, both to him and to some of the random men, &ldquo;because commitment to a single man is a form of idolatry, and draws the appreciative faculties away from the beauty of God in each manifestation of strangeness in each new man.&rdquo; <em>But being promiscuous involves losing contact with this strangeness, as each man is lost or becomes lost to those judgments of mine which make him seem formulaic. And all this loss enforces a belief in God, or at least a desire to believe in God, and provokes a strong desire to invoke God, to mention him.</em></p>
<p>(This I say in reflection, afterwards, and to no one.)</p>
<p>Seven months marks the start of his sexual fieldwork for fairly specific reasons, which I would need to explain in narrative detail in order for it to have any meaning to the reader. To make things quick, I &ldquo;lost my virginity&rdquo; about seven months ago and it happened so late in life—at the age of twenty-four and eleven months—because I had been a transgender man for all of my adult life, from the ages of sixteen to twenty-four. The motives for the subsequent detransition also require detailed narrative, but the quick reason for the detransition is that I wanted to be fucked like and seen as a woman.</p>
<p><em>Well, why did you want to be fucked like and seen as a woman?</em></p>
<p>(No one has asked me this in these terms.)</p>
<p>(I have an academic answer, and a fictive one.)</p>
<p><em>Tell me the fictive one, and then the academic one.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think I can do it in that order, as my training as an academic has still &ldquo;got&rdquo; me. This first post on this new website is going to be essayistic, confessional. I&rsquo;ll be tempted to write paragraphs that seem to argue for something, that are propositional:</p>
<p><em>The female writer is in some indelible sense a kind of overhearer, one who hears what she is not supposed to hear, and who remembers what she is not supposed to remember, and who relays what she is not supposed to relay. The sense of &ldquo;thou shalt not&rdquo; behind each of these acts is so embedded in each woman writer that she will consider herself evil for what she does. Or, she will resist the notion that what she does is evil, and affirm its respectability in the eyes of the public. But if she has the concept of God, she will believe it is God who hates her for the work that he has made her do. And she will love God for hating her. These are theories I like to string around when I have the time to do so.</em></p>
<p>Yes, this is true—I can&rsquo;t get past the notion that what I&rsquo;ve done is unscrupulous and embarrassing, or just outright negative and bad. Does it really matter which adjective I use to talk about this? And at the same time I love calling myself a harlot. So we have this baseline theme of shame or embarrassment, which I always insist doesn&rsquo;t have substantive existence for me: I&rsquo;m incapable of feeling true shame or embarrassment.</p>
<p>But let me reinforce a point for the reader that I am confident about: if I tell you my story correctly, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fictional,&rdquo; but &ldquo;fictive.&rdquo; The stuff I&rsquo;d like to write about in a way that isn&rsquo;t precisely &ldquo;against public life&rdquo; but perhaps under and within and before it—sex, men, womanliness—must bear the traces of fiction&rsquo;s suspension of time, its placement of the reader in a different world. You must read this as a novel. But the material, for sure, isn&rsquo;t fictional, in that it&rsquo;s actual. Or that it has been actual. In other words, it&rsquo;s obscene. Being fucked or catcalled isn&rsquo;t fictional, but it can be fictive, and it must remain obscene.</p>
<p><em>He had light hair, or no hair, or dark hair. He fucked or did not fuck me on the first date, in his nice or squalid room or house. He made me come one or two or three or four or five or six times; he was white. He was Jewish or not Jewish. He fed me well or did not feed me. I liked him or did not like him, or I didn&rsquo;t like him and came to like him, or I was sure I didn&rsquo;t want to see him again. He complimented me on my body or my mind.</em></p>
<p>That I fuck, or that I am fucked, is obscene.</p>
<p>I foreclose the imagination, and I foreclose real contact with the flesh.</p>
<p>I mix the characteristics of real humans, flattening them into this immaterial zone of fiction—that seems to me the ultimate destruction. I make the world of the text fall flat. You feel worse than legal tender—currency itself is meaningless, and even what it stands in for fails to attract us, value stands in for something else which we covet better.</p>
<p>Where am I now? I&rsquo;m not where I was. I&rsquo;m in a room, as I tend to be when I write.</p>
<p>What do women come off as when they write at all, or write like I do?</p>
<p>Is there something masculine in the boastfulness of this text—in the particular way in which bringing up obscenity is a throwing down the gauntlet—a phrase whose literal meaning is so unknown to me that I had to look it up, because I&rsquo;m not a medieval knight.</p>
<p><em>There are six men but eight men whose erections I&rsquo;ve touched. Three men have brought me to the little death I wanted, the first one twice, the second one six times, and the third one once. I can&rsquo;t tell the stories for some reason, or perhaps this is a preface to the stories. I could assign letters to their names—Z, D, A, M, K, A. How to disambiguate?</em></p>
<p>No matter my intent, writing about how I fuck will come off as a boast, as a way of creating an identity based in sexual power. Refusing to subordinate my &ldquo;character&rdquo; to the stage of the dramatic monologue, and refusing to write about myself in the third person, and hence subordinate my materials to the perspective of God, and refusing to engage in the practice of Cusk: all of this demonstrates that I want to seem like a tyrannical force.</p>
<p>No, dearest, I want to be able to tell you things that I wasn&rsquo;t able to tell you when we were together, when we were taken by the birdsong or the scents of Japanese lilac trees in the wind, walking around Fall Creek or Connecticut Hill; I want to talk about the core beliefs which motivate me to act like a silly girl around you, or to be frustratingly distant at times, or to hide under a façade of <em>sprezzatura</em> and comic ease. <em>I believe that when men and women get to know one another in a sexual sense, they are always trying to figure out something about what it means to be a man or a woman. There is something studious and metaphysical about sex; it is the one act in which all humans engage with concepts.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that there is no moment in the sexual act when one forgets that something about our difference is in question. Not individual difference, but categorical difference.</p>
<p>I believe that the ability to maintain a heightened awareness of this question is a marker of love. God ordained that we love via the most difficult of philosophical activities.</p>
<p>In Genesis, the punishments God exacts on Adam and Eve express this difference between the sexes. If I think of the Bible as a text written from a human, mortal perspective, then I think of this as one of the earliest theorizations of sexual difference:</p>
<p><em>[3:15] &ldquo;I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.&rdquo; // [3:16] To the woman he said, &ldquo;I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For the man, the enmity is placed in a way that seems devoid of content. Why will the offspring strike your head, and you his heel? Why do woman and child hate the man?</p>
<p>For the woman, there is this great increase of pain in childbirth—why? Why does she bear this additional difficulty? And why does her desire move towards her ruler?</p>
<p>Both man and woman become the receptacles for something unconditioned, something impossible to tease apart and understand. God wills that we bear his wrath, or his indifferent imperative, his incomprehensible law. You can probably tell that I find something magisterial in this. And something thought-provoking, in a way that&rsquo;s beautiful. I appreciate sexual difference in the way one appreciates a work of art.</p>
<hr>
<p>Strange thing about a blog—unlike a book—is that it spoils itself. It gives you what happened last first, and what happened first last. I&rsquo;ve reversed the order of the posts on this website, to correct for the issue. Of course a blog is not extraordinary as a medium—it functions like a periodical, with the newest news first. And as with magazines and newspapers, we don&rsquo;t expect the reader to read or take interest in the archives. Most of it ends in the literal trash, or the compost heap, or the recycling bin. I&rsquo;m trying to say something about trauma here—to suggest that something about the burying of the past in the form of the blog has something to do with this sense of metonymic slippage, this sense in which blogging lacks a veneer of professionalism or of artistic achievement.</p>
<p>(I don&rsquo;t know what I want to do here, how I want to look.)</p>
<p>If I were a decent novelist, I&rsquo;d have written this all in the third person and give you a sketch of my physiognomy, or &ldquo;physog,&rdquo; as D.H. Lawrence calls that of Bibbles, his beloved-hated &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;—a sort-of-french-bulldog he lived with, and I guess owned, in New Mexico, whom he compared to Whitman, and accused of being too promiscuous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know what I look like soon, but for now here&rsquo;s a little start to wonder at.</p>
<p><i>Bibbles<br>
Little black dog in New Mexico,<br>
Little black snub-nosed bitch with a shoved-out jaw<br>
And a wrinkled reproachful look;<br>
Little black female pup, sort of French bull, they say,<br>
With bits of brindle coming through, like rust, to show you&rsquo;re not pure;<br>
Not pure, Bibbles,<br>
Bubsey, bat-eared dog;<br>
Not black enough!</p>
<p>First live thing I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;owned&rdquo; since the lop-eared rabbits when I was a lad,<br>
And those over-prolific white mice, and Adolf, and Rex whom I didn&rsquo;t own.<br>
And even now, Bibbles, little Ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s you who appropriated me, not I you.<br>
As Benjamin Franklin appropriated Providence to his purposes.</p>
<p>Oh Bibbles, black little bitch<br>
I&rsquo;d never have let you appropriate me, had I known.<br>
I never dreamed, till now, of the awful time the Lord must have, &ldquo;owning&rdquo; humanity.<br>
Especially democratic live-by-love humanity.</p>
<p>Oh Bibbles, oh Pips, oh Pipsey<br>
You little black love-bird!</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t <em>you love</em> everybody!<br>
<em>Just everybody.<br>
You love &rsquo;em all.<br>
Believe in the One Identity, don&rsquo;t you,<br>
You little Walt-Whitmanesque bitch?</em></p>
