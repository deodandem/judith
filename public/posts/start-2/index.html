<p>Holofernes,</p>
<p>What are the granular details of the day&ndash;what is it to write a &ldquo;daily,&rdquo; a &ldquo;diary,&rdquo; a &ldquo;missive,&rdquo; a &ldquo;letter.&rdquo; In this zone of abstraction, of formal constraint, I want to be unhinged and unbuttoned; I want to free associate to an unknown addressee.</p>
<p><em>I live under a rock. I live in a hole.</em></p>
<p><em>Small children overturn rocks to look for insect life.</em></p>
<p><em>A psychoanalyst is a slut who listens—</em></p>
<p><em>These days I do nothing but manual labor, but I also talk—</em></p>
<p>None of these sentences are factual, actual states of affairs, for me in the moment, but I am satisfied to think of them as mine, as true for me. This is what I deploy in order to be &ldquo;unhinged, unbuttoned,&rdquo; at least for now. But I need a stuffed animal. I need a stuffed animal that will talk for me, a mascot that can sit beside me and bark: <em>SMALL CHILDREN OVERTURN ROCKS TO LOOK FOR INSECT LIFE.</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the conundrum: I need a speaker who isn&rsquo;t me, but I&rsquo;m stuck in the &ldquo;I.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve determined that to write from the &ldquo;first person perspective&rdquo; is essential for the task at hand, and that whatever misgivings I have about the confessional, about the memoir, about the autobiographical stance, about the egotism or narcissism of the blog, of autotheory, of autofiction, is the hill I&rsquo;ll die on, this struggle around &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which I think of as a feminine struggle, a struggle to write in a kind of feminized mode which is the sublimated blood-relation of knitting, sewing, cooking, sex work, childcare, concubinage, nunnery, madonnahood, motherhood, or being a wife.</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to describe the granular details of the day. But I also want to be a despot. &ldquo;This is how it is,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;and this is how to enjoy it.&rdquo; I know how to enjoy life, and I&rsquo;ll make you enjoy it the way I like to enjoy it. But I&rsquo;ll do this so well, which is to say, so sneakily, that you don&rsquo;t even realize that I&rsquo;ve done anything to you at all. You can read and believe that this is a free act, the choice to read, the choice to spend time here. You can leave any time. You can leave unaffected. But I&rsquo;m a whore and you&rsquo;ve paid with your time.  I am a pervert with the answer. I know what&rsquo;s right. But I&rsquo;m not talented in this manner; the artifice of it all hurts me. I can&rsquo;t stand the friction between me and the artifice I construct. I wish I were the kind of pure</p>
<p>A tapping noise from some unidentifiable location makes me feel that I cannot articulate what I had wanted to—and I recall a task that I need to do before I leave for the weekend: taking out the recycling. I am going to Delaware with a friend, to look at birds, but this I do not think of when I think of the recycling. I am reminded instead that I have wanted to cycle out into the countryside for two hours or more, or for a little over twenty miles, but I have a meeting in the afternoon, and in the early evening, so I cannot. And I would like to be a <em>flâneuse</em> downtown, but the AQI has risen to 100, and is to rise more as the afternoon comes near; I will go instead to a coffee shop with central AC. There I will assume a posture of focus, but I will peek over the screen and observe the nondescript man with the serious face, or the young students with colorful hair on some sort of a date, or the moderately overweight white woman with ace-flag earrings, and think, &ldquo;Oh, I am in Ithaca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wrote there, but now I am here. I am a woman at a kitchen table.</p>
<p>I am in a house that&rsquo;s not mine, that I stay in during the last week of my four-year stay in this small semi-rural town around a university.  I am in the terminal condition of being a woman who enjoys free housing for brief periods of time because of the men who have sex with me. This is not something worth not talking about—I think that since I am a writer I need to talk about the rooms I write from. The conditions under which I write.</p>
<p>I have grown into the adult task of reading literature in order to write theories about it, or of reading theories in order to revise and contribute to the discourse around subjects which can&rsquo;t be spoken of without feeling the risk of stupidity. And now it&rsquo;s a trap I can&rsquo;t seem to escape, the devolution into glib theories, the shovel-like relation to ideas, to the text, to the world. I would like to have you know this table, this kitchen, this house, instead. Yes, indeed—instead of writing about me, I&rsquo;d like to write about the World.</p>
<p>But I am the pervert who needs to be me, and who needs to do it the same every time, to speak as I do, to inhabit what I see as me, and amplify what I hear come out of myself.</p>
<p>The perversion I speak of is not a perversion based in some notion of deviance—the pervert I speak of is the one who disavows castration, who supplies the (m)Other with the phallus, i.e. the signifier of knowledge, truth, law. <em>I&rsquo;m right, I&rsquo;m here,</em> this is what the phallus means by itself. <em>I have thick black hair, which ends around my shoulders.</em></p>
<p>That act of saying so is an answer to a demand, which is to write, to describe, to turn unformed phenomena into the absolute form of the sentence, the despotic sentence—</p>
<p><em>It curls a little, and in the humid summer air it starts to look even more chaotic.</em></p>
<p>According to Freud, the snakey hair of medusa signifies the phallus, and thus for the viewer, the fear of castration; this is because (a) the snakes are numerous, and (b) the snakes are phallic. I always found this first point fascinating—why is it that the proliferation of the phallus contains some notion of castration? I guess the phallus can only be the only one of its kind. I want to dig down into the phallus and understand it better, but everyone tells me that the phallus is nothing but a signifier of the absolute, and therefore void of content—its power lies, as does the value and power of money, in its internal absence. I almost said &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; absence. I can&rsquo;t tell if my associations here count as &ldquo;free&rdquo; associations, or if I should demote them to the level of theory—theory, a false digging in, a burial of the circulation, death in verbal form. Or is it a shovel, thought?</p>
<hr>
<p>But I wanted to start a website that would be dedicated to sex, which isn&rsquo;t about others.</p>
<p>Freud is accused of building an epistemology around sex, a telos around sex. It seems anti-civilizational to be so fixated on sex, or to be so fixated on the unconscious, which is not exactly a physical phenomenon and not exactly a spiritual one. But we love him for this, for his refusal to concede to one of two poles and his ability to imagine something of a border that isn&rsquo;t a border, something that floats above or below, something that we can metaphorize about <em>ad nauseum</em> until we realize that there&rsquo;s no reason to, because what he thinks of as the unconscious is accessible in our dreams, in our sex, in our slips and falls and mistakes. I&rsquo;m not saying that sex doesn&rsquo;t involve others, but it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;about&rdquo; them.</p>
<p>In sex, concepts are suspended in some kind of suspension, a gel that contains words in admixture. The swirled words that represent those concepts mix around, and if the suspension is twirled backwards, each glyph returns to its separate discernible form.</p>
<p>The room I sit in doesn&rsquo;t have mixtures in suspension. But it has a stew of white greek gigante beans, which are probably just some kind of runner bean, <em>Phaseolus coccineus.</em> I cooked them with fresh young onions from a local farmshare that a current man I see participates in, and wilted celery from the same farmshare, several weeks old at this point, and cumin and garlic and garam masala. A random assortment of available ingredients—unlike him I never use a recipe. And the room contains chocolate rye cookies which I did make from a recipe, from <em>Tartine No. 3.</em> The recipe accords the cookies with prestige, as does the baking chocolate I ordered online from Utah.</p>
<p>The cookies are made with eggs that have been beaten until they foam into a suspension that has &ldquo;tripled in volume,&rdquo; and the other usual ingredients: sugar, butter, baking soda. I&rsquo;m describing this food because it&rsquo;s real to me, and when someone presses against me I feel as mindless as a cloud, as a natural formation—solid and transient—or like beaten eggs, or like the softened interior of a simmered bean. These are all purified substances, purified but infolded and manifold and complicated because organic. I want to convey to you that there&rsquo;s something real going on here, something that&rsquo;s more than what I think, more than what I&rsquo;m able to say. But it doesn&rsquo;t work, does it?  An idea about myself gives way to digression, and the idea is substantiated with an illustration, which is experienced as a digression and not as a hypotactic illustration. I&rsquo;m too theoretical, or I&rsquo;m a machine.</p>
<p>Sex, sugar, butter, eggs foaming into a suspension that&rsquo;s tripled in volume;<br>
Snakes, AQI, Delaware, a house that&rsquo;s not my own, a woman at a kitchen table;<br>
A definition of the pervert that comes from Lacan. An idea about thought as shovel.<br>
Freud, Lacan, Freud as main heroic character, Lacan as mother, &ldquo;psychoanalysis.&rdquo;<br>
Man in the background and woman who refers to men as a collective: &ldquo;men.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently, I started watching <em>Sex and the City,</em> and that gave me some ideas about what I was up to. Well, here&rsquo;s someone who claims to be a &ldquo;sexual anthropologist&rdquo;—maybe that&rsquo;s what I am, or want to be. But it becomes a pick-up line to commence a drama around an anxious attachment to a confusing man, and we&rsquo;re made to believe that the drama we should care about most is the drama of attachment, the drama of desire, which may be higher and finer and more emotional than the onslaught of experience we associate with Samantha&rsquo;s prolific sexual conquests and acquisitions and activities.</p>
<p>Who cares about the unchallenged Samantha when Carrie asks again and again why Big won&rsquo;t tell her what she wants to hear—&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;? I didn&rsquo;t care about love, I wanted to know more about sex, when I started to watch the show. I was disappointed, but I kept on watching—there was much to enjoy in the high heels, the dresses, and the true comic moments, which all involve speaking of idea and types and in generalities, but with imagination and metaphor and paronomasia. Carrie looks so brilliant sometimes.</p>
<p>Did I really want her to be a columnist above all else?</p>
<p>I am not, in fact, interested in a science of the sexual, in a social science around sex. The notion of sexual knowledge repels me—sex for me is what constitutes the breakdown of sense, whatever sense could be—and sex, therefore, doesn&rsquo;t equate to the fact of its occurrence. If there&rsquo;s anything I know about sex, it&rsquo;s that I can&rsquo;t find it, can&rsquo;t write it.</p>
<p>I rarely write anything personal for the public because I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense: it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that anyone should relate to what I have to say about my life in a way that feels useful or engaging even as minor entertainment. Something about how I come off in text is too serious, and the stuff I want to write about is too unimportant, frivolous: gossip about my sex life, or about what I eat, or about what I want to wear, or do wear.</p>
<p>Since I moved to the city, I look around a lot. It would be good to write more about the appreciation I feel for what people wear, and to transform what I see into a string of stylistic associations—I do not see women as beautiful for no reason; tere is always a partial object to be picked out—the whiteness of a dress, the length of a torso, the straightness of the hair. I am also looked at, and on several occasions, men have approached me, spoken to me, asked to meet later. I have met men online and gone through the ritual of meeting and of having sex later, in order, it seems, to write about it.</p>
<p>What matters is less the successful production of a story, but the experience of feeling that I have something to write about. I wonder if this is the function of Mr. Big in <em>SATC</em>—to produce the feeling in Carrie that there&rsquo;s something leftover to write about, or something that exists at the edge of her career—just in site, and fodder for the memoir, but not completely encapsulated in what she can write about for her job. And so the film gives us this sense of doubleness, an interiority in the middle of all the commodification of her life and her friends&rsquo; lives. It&rsquo;s important to me that men are a source of private edification, which is why I write about them on a website that exists in public but which no one reads save one friend, meaning that it almost functions as a form of indirect correspondence. Like a nineteenth-century woman who will never be remembered because all she wrote were letters, or like the young woman in a novel written by a man, whom we get to know through her letters. I feel the pressure or force of sex as a form of spiritual employment—God wants me to make sex into writing every time it happens.</p>
<hr>
<p>A harlot, like God, is indifferent in her application of the law—that she sell herself to whoever she manages to capture as a client, as a &ldquo;trick.&rdquo; But if a harlot is also an artist, she puts together two unlike things—the rote application of a law, and the iconoclastic nature of creation; she is passive and forceful. The idea I have of the harlot is of someone rather funny and strange—she&rsquo;s comical and seductive, but also harsh and cruel, even to the point where one might call her noble. A noble sadist, in the style of Sade, who always surprised me insofar as he could make me laugh and make me wet often at the same time.</p>
<p>And yet when I write as this ideal of a harlot, I feel myself to be anything but easy or seductive or fun to be with; I become heavy and serious in a way that perturbs me, fatigues me, tires me out. I become a sexless shovel. I am troubled by certain realities which I cannot speak of, and that I must entertain in order to grow around or away from scenes of violence which I cannot write about, at least not here, or now. I cannot write about so much because it would seem wrong. I am sure that Carrie failed to write about sex, or that she failed to show herself as a writer of sex, for good reason—that the drama around Mr. Big was a needed domestication of something far more difficult at the heart of the show, which I wanted to contribute to, make space for inside of my disappointment.</p>
<p>We need main characters, dramas centered around two or three!</p>
<p>How is the harlot able to survive under these conditions?</p>
<p>She wants everybody to be there, in the text!</p>
<p>I want these associations of mine to be promiscuous in all forms and all forms of content—free association, or unfree association, and a lack of formlessness, or not enough of a form to engender freedom, these are the subjects I&rsquo;ll lash myself to, as I listen to the siren song of the better writers, the ones I admire towards whom I wish to shut my mouth and listen. But this is the reverse of the myth—I sing my incessant ugly song, and the sirens off there live, in silence, and hear what I do, but don&rsquo;t listen—for there&rsquo;s no reason to experience temptation, no desire to come over here, and too much labor to continue with.</p>
