<p><em>I am an American with this little domain: judith-writing.com.</em></p>
<p>Once I started a blog that was out of public circulation. I believed it would represent me better than anything written for a public or unknown audience. Rather than an &ldquo;audience,&rdquo; I had two addressees: my Self, and the Other I chose to share the site with. The site was conceived, moreover, a safeguard against the ongoingness of life: I wanted to know its end, or to know that it would in fact have its limits. And I wanted to define those limits with the work: only after I had written something I felt proud of would I be permitted to die. And so I gave the site the domain of 23-46.com, and named it &ldquo;Against Public Life.&rdquo; The title would take a while to explore, but the URL is simple: I began the website when I was 23, and hoped to die at the age of 46.  It was a safeguard against the decorum required of public writing, which I believed would keep me from working to write what mattered most to me. I often preferred to think of it as a space of formalistic, structural, and creative freedom, but it was also a place for the most basic or mundane form of inward research: self-oriented diaristic text, incidental. So it was a humble website, but also a rather grandiose one.</p>
<p>I had been reading Montaigne and thinking about the humble but brilliant origins of the <em>essai,</em> and I had been familiar for several months with the speculative beauty of Sheila Heti&rsquo;s &ldquo;autofiction,&rdquo; which often read to me like Pascal&rsquo;s <em>Pensées</em>, and I knew Rachel Cusk&rsquo;s indirect discourse of the <em>Outline</em> novels, wherein the narrator fades into the wall of her own narration: she tells us what she hears, often in the words of her interlocutors, and what she says in response to their words, but without betraying her inner beliefs.</p>
<p>In this sense she became a narrator, an off-center, omniscient, immaterial, female God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I wanted to be God. I wanted to be done-for. I had a notion that in order to die, I would have to write first, and I would write as much as I could until I arrived at the end: I planned to die at the age of forty-six, which happened to be twice my age at the time I started the website. I had chosen the number on account of the fact that it was the age at which César Vallejo had died. Vallejo was the writer I felt closest to for a while.</p>
<p>In recent weeks I&rsquo;ve considered what it would mean to make the private website public, but I find in it a mixture of two issues that keep me from doing so. The first lies in a sense of its incoherence, its meaninglessness under the gaze of an outsider. But this first point is only significant because of the second, which is that the site is so full of reports on men. Men I&rsquo;ve known, men I&rsquo;ve desired, men who are all alive. This practice of writing about men strikes me as embarrassing and unscrupulous, probably because of its sexual nature. I&rsquo;m sure women talk about their dating lives with their friends or confidants of whatever kind, which seems fine, but it seems seriously wrong for a woman to write an ongoing series of texts about the men she sees without marketing it as advice or poetry or fiction of some kind. Talk about one&rsquo;s dates is meant to be inchoate, and embarrassing, and unrecorded save in contexts of fictive artifice. What I&rsquo;m doing is a perversion of the normal practices of confession, which should be oral and evanescent or highly wrought. I suppose the barest marker of this perversion lies in the fact that I am not asking for advice or affirmation from a listener when I write about the men. Neither am I looking to make detailed fictional worlds around these characters. What I&rsquo;m doing is neither sufficiently artistic nor sufficiently social to be swallowed as usual, and some of this lies in the lack of dialogue, the lack of a question. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; what my &ldquo;goals&rdquo; are.</p>
<p>What matters, at the core of all this, is that there&rsquo;s a terrible, quasi-infanticidal streak in what I write. This terror or terribleness of mine is a decadent affliction that results from having the time and the education and the ability to spend long stretches of time in study. I believe I can make these sexual experiences into a kind of tapestry of tales, but I don&rsquo;t in fact seem interested in manufacturing the perspective or style or form which would make these experiences coherent. I think what matters here is also less the question of whether I have the ability to rewire raw experience into something meaningful to the collective (or just meaningful to me, even), than the fact that I think of my writing as a sometimes terrible symptom, as an intransitive symptom of nothing, which is to say that it&rsquo;s a symptom that has to do with the melancholic&rsquo;s sense of her intrinsic abandonment.</p>
<p>That the desire to write on a very particularly maintained website would dovetail with a pursuit of sexual knowledge seems worth reflecting on, however, no matter how much I claim that the links may be arbitrary or incidental. The website and its diaristic effusions—the bare form of it all—had everything to do with my relationship with femaleness.</p>
<hr>
<p>In its briefest form, femaleness to me is &ldquo;zero&rdquo;: it is nothing more than the symbol of nothing, a symbol for what comes before enumeration, but which is symbolized, for utility&rsquo;s sake, as a numeral. It is a ground for measure, but not measurable in a scalar sense—there&rsquo;s no use in dividing or multiplying with femaleness, and it demands that we apprehend it as both somewhat unreal, and as violently, indelibly material: zero is a terrible amount to have, or it&rsquo;s the absolute best amount to have of something.</p>
<p>I was thought of as female when I came out of the womb; I was assigned as such on the basis of the inspection of the genitalia. At the age of six I decided I would be a boy, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure if this was possible, and wasn&rsquo;t sure that it was impossible. At the age of sixteen I found that it was possible, and became a self-determined male. I was eighteen when I started to take testosterone, and twenty-four when, for reasons that cannot be easily distilled, I went off testosterone, and became female, and became a woman. I became a woman who believed herself to be a woman and who dated men.</p>
<p>In other words it was never evident to me that femaleness was a determinate condition, and while I do have a specific experience of the cunt that is specific to the cunt, I don&rsquo;t think in &ldquo;I have a cunt, therefore I am female&rdquo; conditionals. I feel female on the basis of how I look and how men interact with me, and some of this does in fact involve the cunt.</p>
<p>I see various men over the course of seven months. There is a new man each month, or a new man or two. Each month, I meet with the &ldquo;new man or two&rdquo; and sometimes have sex with him, sometimes within several hours of the first exchange of words. I have had the experience of regularly seeing two men during the same stretch of time, blocking out one day of the week for the first and another, non-contiguous day of the week for the other. I have also had the experience of being fucked by two different men within the span of twelve hours. These numbers, and the attendant logistics of blocking out time, matter insofar as they mark the rhythm or temporal texture of this promiscuity. I am not yet particularly profligate, as my &ldquo;body count&rdquo; remains in the single digits. But I wish to know more men; promiscuity is something that&rsquo;s &ldquo;ego-syntonic&rdquo; for me.  I am in psychoanalysis; I see a psychoanalyst four times a week, and it&rsquo;s important for me to use that term—&ldquo;promiscuity&rdquo;—in the sessions. &ldquo;I believe in promiscuity,&rdquo; I say, both to my analyst and to some of the random men, &ldquo;because commitment to a single man is a form of idolatry, and draws the appreciative faculties away from the beauty of God in each manifestation of strangeness in each new man.&rdquo; I want to be a kind of Walt Whitman.</p>
<p>Seven months marks the start of his sexual fieldwork for fairly specific reasons. I would need to explain this in narrative detail in order for it to have any meaning to the reader. To mdake things quick, I &ldquo;lost my virginity&rdquo; about seven months ago to someone I had wanted very much; the motives for the detransition involved a desire to be fucked like and seen as a woman, and it was initially through him that I came to this realization.</p>
<p><em>Well, why did you want to be fucked like and seen as a woman?</em></p>
<p>(No one has asked me this in these terms.)</p>
<p>(I have an academic answer, and a fictive one.)</p>
<p><em>Tell me the fictive one, and then the academic one.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Cunt as a word felt like an assault to me, the first time I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judith, as she heard this, smiled, and asked if it was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was true, it felt like an assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holofernes had been reflecting on an incident in which he had been called a cunt. He hadn&rsquo;t known anything about his field of reference then, and heard it only as bare assault.</p>
<p>Judith seemed skeptical of his story, even though it was earnestly his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I heard the word, it was in art class. A boy was telling us that he knew the worst word, the worst, most unspeakable word, worse than &lsquo;fuck.&rsquo; The rest of us around the table were girls. He whispered it into my neighbor&rsquo;s ear, and then into mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t experienced it as shocking—if anything I was surprised to hear this word I had never heard before. Maybe I even felt,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;sort of honored to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>She really has to make it out like she knows better,</em> thought Holofernes.</p>
<hr>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think I can do it in that order, as my training as an academic has still &ldquo;got&rdquo; me. This first post on this new website is going to be essayistic, confessional. I&rsquo;ll be tempted to write paragraphs that seem to argue for something, that are propositional:</p>
<p><em>The female writer is in some indelible sense a kind of overhearer, one who hears what she is not supposed to hear, and who remembers what she is not supposed to remember, and who relays what she is not supposed to relay. The sense of &ldquo;thou shalt not&rdquo; behind each of these acts is so embedded in each woman writer that she will consider herself evil for what she does. Or, she will resist the notion that what she does is evil, and affirm its respectability in the eyes of the public. But if she has the concept of God, she will believe it is God who hates her for the work that he has made her do. And she will love God for hating her. These are theories I like to string around when I have the time to do so.</em></p>
<p>Yes, this is true—I can&rsquo;t get past the notion that what I&rsquo;ve done is unscrupulous and embarrassing, or just outright negative and bad. Does it really matter which adjective I use to talk about this? And at the same time I love calling myself a harlot. So we have this baseline theme of shame or embarrassment, which I always insist doesn&rsquo;t have substantive existence for me: I&rsquo;m incapable of feeling true shame or embarrassment.</p>
<p>But let me reinforce a point for the reader that I am confident about: if I tell you my story correctly, it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fictional,&rdquo; but &ldquo;fictive.&rdquo; The stuff I&rsquo;d like to write about in a way that isn&rsquo;t precisely &ldquo;against public life&rdquo; but perhaps under and within and before it—sex, men, womanliness—must bear the traces of fiction&rsquo;s suspension of time, its placement of the reader in a different world. You must read this as a novel. But the material, for sure, isn&rsquo;t fictional, in that it&rsquo;s actual. Or that it has been actual. In other words, it&rsquo;s obscene. Being fucked or catcalled isn&rsquo;t fictional, but it can be fictive, and it must remain obscene.</p>
<p><em>He had light hair, or no hair, or dark hair. He fucked or did not fuck me on the first date, in his nice or squalid room or house. He made me come one or two or three or four or five or six times; he was white. He was Jewish or not Jewish. He fed me well or did not feed me. I liked him or did not like him, or I didn&rsquo;t like him and came to like him, or I was sure I didn&rsquo;t want to see him again. He complimented me on my body or my mind.</em></p>
<p>That I fuck, or that I am fucked, is obscene.</p>
<p>I foreclose the imagination, and I foreclose real contact with the flesh.</p>
<p>I mix the characteristics of real humans, flattening them into this immaterial zone of fiction—that seems to me the ultimate destruction. I make the world of the text fall flat. You feel worse than legal tender—currency itself is meaningless, and even what it stands in for fails to attract us, value stands in for something else which we covet better.</p>
<p>Where am I now? I&rsquo;m not where I was. I&rsquo;m in a room, as I tend to be when I write.</p>
<p>What do women come off as when they write at all, or write like I do?</p>
<p>Is there something masculine in the boastfulness of this text—in the particular way in which bringing up obscenity is a throwing down the gauntlet—a phrase whose literal meaning is so unknown to me that I had to look it up, because I&rsquo;m not a medieval knight.</p>
<p><em>There are six men but eight men whose erections I&rsquo;ve touched. Three men have brought me to the little death I wanted, the first one twice, the second one six times, and the third one once. I can&rsquo;t tell the stories for some reason, or perhaps this is a preface to the stories. I could assign letters to their names—Z, D, A, M, K, A. How to disambiguate?</em></p>
<p>No matter my intent, writing about how I fuck will come off as a boast, as a way of creating an identity based in sexual power. Refusing to subordinate my &ldquo;character&rdquo; to the stage of the dramatic monologue, and refusing to write about myself in the third person, and hence subordinate my materials to the perspective of God, and refusing to engage in the practice of Cusk: all of this demonstrates that I want to seem like a tyrannical force.</p>
<p>No, dearest, I want to be able to tell you things that I wasn&rsquo;t able to tell you when we were together, when we were taken by the birdsong or the scents of Japanese lilac trees in the wind, walking around Fall Creek or Connecticut Hill; I want to talk about the core beliefs which motivate me to act like a silly girl around you, or to be frustratingly distant at times, or to hide under a façade of <em>sprezzatura</em> and comic ease. <em>I believe that when men and women get to know one another in a sexual sense, they are always trying to figure out something about what it means to be a man or a woman. There is something studious and metaphysical about sex; it is the one act in which all humans engage with concepts.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that there is no moment in the sexual act when one forgets that something about our difference is in question. Not individual difference, but categorical difference.</p>
<p>I believe that the ability to maintain a heightened awareness of this question is a marker of love. God ordained that we love via the most difficult of philosophical activities.</p>
<p>In Genesis, the punishments God exacts on Adam and Eve express this difference between the sexes. If I think of the Bible as a text written from a human, mortal perspective, then I think of this as one of the earliest theorizations of sexual difference:</p>
<p><em>[3:15] &ldquo;I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.&rdquo; // [3:16] To the woman he said, &ldquo;I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For the man, the enmity is placed in a way that seems devoid of content. Why will the offspring strike your head, and you his heel? Why do woman and child hate the man?</p>
<p>For the woman, there is this great increase of pain in childbirth—why? Why does she bear this additional difficulty? And why does her desire move towards her ruler?</p>
<p>Both man and woman become the receptacles for something unconditioned, something impossible to tease apart and understand. God wills that we bear his wrath, or his indifferent imperative, his incomprehensible law. You can probably tell that I find something magisterial in this. And something thought-provoking, in a way that&rsquo;s beautiful. I appreciate sexual difference in the way one appreciates a work of art.</p>
<hr>
<p>Strange thing about a blog—unlike a book—is that it spoils itself. It gives you what happened last first, and what happened first last. I&rsquo;ve reversed the order of the posts on this website, to correct for the issue. Of course a blog is not extraordinary as a medium—it functions like a periodical, with the newest news first. And as with magazines and newspapers, we don&rsquo;t expect the reader to read or take interest in the archives. Most of it ends in the literal trash, or the compost heap, or the recycling bin. I&rsquo;m trying to say something about trauma here—to suggest that something about the burying of the past in the form of the blog has something to do with this sense of metonymic slippage, this sense in which blogging lacks a veneer of professionalism or of artistic achievement.</p>
<p>(I don&rsquo;t know what I want to do here, how I want to look.)</p>
<p>If I were a decent novelist, I&rsquo;d have written this all in the third person and give you a sketch of my physiognomy, or &ldquo;physog,&rdquo; as D.H. Lawrence calls that of Bibbles, his beloved-hated &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;—a sort-of-french-bulldog he lived with, and I guess owned, in New Mexico, whom he compared to Whitman, and accused of being too promiscuous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know what I look like soon, but for now here&rsquo;s a little start to wonder at.</p>
