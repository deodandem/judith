<content><p>I took a night off from work to go see <em>Parthenope</em> with S. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since the week I started camming, so there was a lot to talk about over dinner and after seeing the film. I loved <em>Parthenope.</em> I am still thinking about it, though part of me believes a movie like that shouldn&rsquo;t be dwelt upon scientifically. Like a fragrance with a beautiful onset, it should be appreciated for the beauty of first experience, and allowed to dry down into something musky, inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The last week has been my slowest week in terms of profits; I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that February is ending, or to do with the American economy, or with the mere fact that I hadn&rsquo;t streamed more the previous week. I took too many days off the previous week because I was satisfied with how much I was earning, really. And also because I wanted to write. Now I&rsquo;m sort of doing that again, thinking about this movie about a beautiful woman&hellip;</p>
<p>Per the movie&rsquo;s tag line, <em>&ldquo;is she a siren or a myth?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>S, by the way, is my classical ideal of a beautiful man who isn&rsquo;t at all demanding of time or energy, he&rsquo;s the perfectly round, frictionless, spherical sort of object that makes it easy to &ldquo;roll with.&rdquo; He is actively non-monogamous, not in the almost righteous way that some poly people can be, but with a kind of wide-eyed innocence and curiosity. I met him a few months after he moved out of the apartment he had shared with his ex-wife, and since then, he&rsquo;s accumulated a string of lovers, and I am always curious to hear about his journey with these new women. I want to listen; in reality I speak more than he does. He&rsquo;s more inquisitive than most of the men I&rsquo;ve been with, as if he were empty of his own &ldquo;content,&rdquo; but the reality is that he is slower to articulate his experience of life.</p>
<p>When I first met him I was duly smitten, it was the first time in a long time that I had met a man I truly found very beautiful, whose beauty was at the forefront of my mind. I was a bit disappointed when I realized that he wasn&rsquo;t one to express desire to see me as frequently as I wanted to see him, but I quickly adjusted to reality, and though you could say I lost some amount of feeling for his beauty, his beauty is constant; I still appreciate him as a beautiful man and friend.</p>
<hr>
<p>Working in sex, or doing sex work, has displaced and sublimated a lot of my questions and anxieties about love and desire. If I were not so occupied with streaming, camming, and making drafts of &ldquo;content&rdquo; for subscription sites, I&rsquo;d probably be wondering who my next subject should be, my next object of thought, my next locus of questions and fantasies. On CB, men ask me what I&rsquo;m into, whether I have a type, whether I might be into them or like them were no money involved. The reality is that I do have something of a type, constructed through my history of relationships, but that my history has led me to a place where I seem unable to hold on tightly to a fantasy of an ideal love-object.</p>
<p>Parthenope has a narcotic effect on screen; she moves with such languid slowness that her body becomes a kind of measure of time, a measure of how long it takes for our eyes to glide across every available surface of her body; of course our eyes linger and flicker and jump between eyes and nose and mouth and hair and back and vertebrae and breast, but really what makes her so narcotic is her smile, a smile which invites interest, because it seems that she knows, with that smile, that we are interested in looking at her, and in knowing what lies behind that smile, hence the question she is most commonly asked:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What are you thinking about, Parthenope?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the question I&rsquo;m asked when I&rsquo;m on stream, but rather, &ldquo;how are you,&rdquo; a question to which I never quite know how to respond. Maybe I can&rsquo;t talk about the truth of what I&rsquo;m thinking about, which is commonly, when is my next tip going to arrive and under what circumstances; what have I done to attract the flow of money, what does the person on the other end receive or achieve by sending money to me in this way, on a public ledger, with each transaction making a little sound for everyone watching, though if a tip note is attached, it&rsquo;s only visible to the woman, though she often responds to these notes out loud.</p>
<p>Anyway, the idea is that I smile, I invite, I wonder what leads people to be attracted enough to me to give me something, and I wonder what I can do to invite more attraction, and I wonder about the woman on the movie screen who might be wondering about the same thing. In the movie, it&rsquo;s implied that her beauty causes someone to take his own life, and she wonders about this. It darkens her face, she appears in shadows instead of in pure sunlight, she cries, she presses her face into a stern gaze, or a sad, wistful, slightly droopy aspect.</p>
<p>We learn from seeing this transformation that beauty really does seem to come from the open invitation of the smile, and from the question of what lies behind it; sadness made visible indexes its own feeling, it&rsquo;s plain and without mystery, compared to the mythical smile of a virgin creature. <em>Parthenope,</em> the name of one of the sirens who Odysseus encountered, comes from the Greek word for virgin, and the word I was familiar with before I saw the film, <em>parthenogenesis,</em> refers to asexual reproduction. Smiling, even if it displays a kind of sexual knowledge, is really a kind of virginal act, insofar as it betrays no knowledge of an inviting smile&rsquo;s consequences, which might lie just minutes or hours ahead.</p>
<hr>
<p>Being bad at sustaining love-feeling, being bad with men in the sense that I attract and flirt and do not consummate invitations into more intense emotional relationships, I&rsquo;ve come away from the last year with a sense of blankness, in a sense I am not so invested in worrying about how bad I am at love, but because I attempt to now make a business of flirtation, I am more aware than before of what lurks beneath the surface, or of how my work allows me to avoid dating.</p>
<p>S is such a perfect intermittent partner because I am not dating him in order to attain some sense of closure; he could be there or not there and it wouldn&rsquo;t apparently matter. Interestingly enough I am not often turned on when we fuck, and I suspect it&rsquo;s the lack of intense emotional feeling that makes this my reality.</p>
<p>The irony is that the perfect and beautiful sexual partner correlates with the absence of sexual satisfaction, and that the extremely asymmetrical relation between client-tipper and provider-streamer gets me much more aroused. Not knowing anything about what you look like, seeing no qualitaties of appearance beyond that of the username, and its color, which signifies how much you&rsquo;ve tipped in the last two weeks, and the messages you type, and the quantities you tip, and yet still having this bodily response to what seems so purely symbolic, allows me to enter into a relation which feels immensely and absolutely erotic.</p>
<p>And of course there is the dimension of me looking at myself on screen. This image is unique to the activity of camming; the image I see of myself in the mirror, or in the photographs I might otherwise take of myself, are nothing alike. It&rsquo;s this image constructed for someone else to look at, this image which will only modify itself to perform certain acts when it receives tokens from tippers, that&rsquo;s the libidinal, eroticized image that I come to when I do come on stream.</p>
<p>I do recognize, now, how much of my sexual fantasy life must have lived in the world of cameras and mirrors, even before I began camming, otherwise how could I have such a genuinely strong physical response to my work?</p>
<p>I think I do want to dwell on this scientifically. What makes libidinal currents, flows of energy, so potent when what&rsquo;s flowing between me and the other, is nothing much more than a video stream, and the receipt of a transaction? Is it a purification ritual, a paring down of all of our circumstantial attributes into just the necessary thing, an image, which invites, and the symbol of the number, which designates a quantity (and therefore a quality) of interest?</p>
<hr>
<p>Clean, and yes, pure, this is what work feels like when it approaches an ideal. I speak very little of the physical sensation so far, of reclining on the bed, often propped up on one bent arm, and adjusting my body in ways that I deem visually appealing, and of smelling the fluids that come out of me onto my fingers or the glass dildo I&rsquo;ve been using on stream. The feeling of being naked, of being cold sometimes, of doing crunches to raise my core temperature, of wearing a thong which I would not normally wear, of smelling my spit and cunt juices. But ultimately the quality of my attention feels clean and pure because its both so diffuse and so fully directed towards the activity in the chat box on the screen.</p>
