<p>A little before the middle of July. Apartment semi-vacated, and all objects removed from the kitchen counter in preparation for counter work. Later to find a mild gray shade of paint used for the cosmetic renovation. She went to visit two apartments in NYC, where she planned to move within a month, and stayed with a long-time friend, L, who had once been her lover. L was now with a new girlfriend, which made her cheerful and distant. The year before they had had sex under similar circumstances: a recreational visit with some shopping destinations, and with the desire to see her psychoanalyst, but without plans to move. J had bought a red ramen bowl and two dishes; one pink, one brown, chrysanthemum-shaped.</p>
<p>It had been four years since she had last moved. The last move had been bicoastal: from Stanford, CA to Ithaca, NY. It had been happy and respectable to move between the two places, from one academic institution to another, from one degree program to another. The impending move, the present move, was instead suffused with an air of mistakenness. It took her away from the calm of the university town to the numerosity of the bodies of men in the city. This caused some, like her mother, to believe that she would fester there, or that she would not finish her dissertation. J thought this was a reasonable concern. Before the visit, she had interacted with three of her men; one via letter, one at his house, and one on break where he worked. She did not maintain an exclusive, God&rsquo;s-eye-view of her relations with them, but rather chose to speak or write to each about the others, such that each had a kind of God&rsquo;s-eye-view of where they stood in relation to her and her Others. She also had a fourth man, her analyst, who knew a little more about them than the rest, though it was hard to say if he knew that much more.</p>
<p>She figured she was moving in order to enter a kind of religious order, the religious order of psychoanalysis. But there was also the precarity of trying to make creative work, in that place, in the non-religious ones who worked freelance <em>Set dresser,</em> the profession of a potential roommate. <em>Pro-domme,</em> a word she learned from the mouth of a man who took her back to his place. After the visit she went straight to A&rsquo;s place and ate his food. A had seemed to miss her for the first time, while she had been away for the five nights. He solicited her, he made her sweetly marinated chicken with perilla leaves and purple rice, he made vanilla ice cream, which he served with grilled peaches. She spoke about her time with the men in the city. After a while, she said something facetious about how she couldn&rsquo;t respond to messages from the other men. A&rsquo;s look was one of a kind of half-facetious, half-incredulous shock: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in my house and trying to message other men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fucked her with a lot of force that night. He tugged at her skin with his teeth, he bit into it, he compressed it, he seemd to want to wrinkle her and tear her and bend her into new forms. Sometimes the sensation was so intense that she had to push his head or fingers away. She never felt more desired than she did that night. What messages had she, in fact, received? &ldquo;i could have come to fuck you,&rdquo; from M, her second Ithaca boyfriend, upon learning that she was back. <em>no you couldn&rsquo;t have, my pussy was reserved,</em> she wanted to write back, but she didn&rsquo;t, as it was enough to mouth the words in her mind.</p>
<p><em>My life is sweet with men,</em> she wrote in a document on her 27-inch screen.</p>
